# Barber-Shop
Problem of Barber shop solved by priority scheduling. The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority and in this problem  all the customers will arrive at the same time and the barber will take them by their priority.
We have one barber chair and 5 customer waiting chairs.
When there is no customer the barber sleeps on the barber chair, when the customer arrives he will wake the barber up or wait at the customer chair when the barber cutting some one else hair, when the chairs are full the new customer will leave
